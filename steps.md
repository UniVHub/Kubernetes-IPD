# Kubernetes Service Exposure with Minikube (NGINX)

In this document, we will demonstrate how to expose a deployment running an NGINX container using minikube tunnel. The guide details how to expose this deployment using a LoadBalancer type service. Additionally, we will show how to access a NodePort type service.

## Steps

1. **Start Minikube from Scratch**

Begin by stopping, deleting, and starting Minikube:

```bash
minikube stop 
minikube delete 
minikube start
```

2. **Create a Tunnel in Minikube**

Create a tunnel in Minikube to access the services running in the cluster:

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

3. **Display Available Kubernetes Objects**

Display the objects available in Kubernetes:

```bash
watch -n 3 kubectl get all
```

4. **Create the deployment**

Create the deployment using the following command:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

5. **Expose the Deployment**

Expose the deployment using a LoadBalancer type service:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
```

6. **Validate the External IP Generated by Minikube**

To see the external IP generated by Minikube, go to the terminal where you ran the `watch -n 3 kubectl get all` command and look for the `EXTERNAL-IP` field of `service/nginx.`


7. Create a NodePort Type Service

First, export the deployment as a NodePort service:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port=80
```

If there is an error, you can delete the service and try again:

```bash
kubectl delete service nginx
```

8. Validate the NodePort Service 

Validate the NodePort service in the terminal where you ran the `watch -n 3 kubectl get all` command. Look for the `PORT(S)` field of `service/nginx.`
